### Description

A restaurant recommendation mobile app using Tinder-like swipe UI that facilitates choosing restaurants as a group. The idea is the following:
* Allows users to create groups for other users to join.
* Users choose the cuisine according to their preference.
* If the user is dining alone, a restaurant will be randomly selected based on the types of cuisine the user has chosen.
* For users dining with a group, cuisines would be chosen based on a group vote.
* After the cuisines have been chosen, 10 closest resturants matching the criteria would returned.
* The resturants would be shown to the user one at a time, each taking up a full page. 
* then users can swipe to decide if they vote or not vote for the resturant.
* After all users have voted, the app would return the result of this vote so that users could pick one themselves based on the votes.
